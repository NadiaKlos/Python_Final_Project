# Python_Final_Project

The dataset represents ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. Each row concerns hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes, who underwent laboratory, medications, and stayed up to 14 days. The goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge.
I made a streamlit application to present my results on this project:
Here is the home page, where we can see the information about the dataset.

Then we can see some vizualisation concerning the hospitals and the patients

Finaly, the "Modeling" part explain how we did it (the predicted column, machine-learning methods etc)

and propose us to test the prediction models with the data
